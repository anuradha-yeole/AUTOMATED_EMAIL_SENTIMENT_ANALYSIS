Welcome to my GitHub project, where I've developed automating email sentiment analysis. Leveraging the power of Google Apps Script, the Google Spreadsheet API, and advanced pretrained models, this project is designed to streamline the process of analyzing email sentiments.

Key Features:

Email Data Extraction: My project uses Google Apps Script to seamlessly extract email data from your Gmail account, allowing you to effortlessly process large volumes of emails for sentiment analysis.

Sentiment Classification: The heart of this project lies in the use of pretrained VanderSentiments models to classify emails into three primary sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative.

Detailed Sentiment Analysis: Beyond the initial sentiment classification, I've integrated TextBlob to provide a deeper sentiment analysis. This feature identifies nuanced emotions like anger, trust, fear, disappointment, and more within emails, giving you a comprehensive sentiment profile.

Google Spreadsheet Integration: To make your data accessible and organized, my project utilizes the Google Spreadsheet API, ensuring you can easily manage and interpret the analyzed email data.
